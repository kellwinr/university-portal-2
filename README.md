## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Redesign a complex academic portal with **improved usability**
- Reduce **cognitive load** through better layout and information hierarchy
- Apply modern UI trends without sacrificing clarity
- Demonstrate **UX thinking + front-end implementation**
- Create a portfolio-ready system inspired by real-world academic workflows

## 🚀 v2 Improvements (Compared to v1)

Version 2 focuses on **performance, interactivity, and visual polish**.

- **Glassmorphism Design System**  
  Use of `backdrop-filter: blur`, translucency, depth layers, and soft shadows to create a modern UI while maintaining readability.

- **High-Performance Animations**  
  GPU-accelerated transitions, smooth fade-ins, and a custom parallax background for subtle motion without distraction.

- **Interactive Timetable System**  
  A dynamic **30-minute interval grid** with macOS-style floating windows for lecturer and class details.

- **Modern Data Presentation**  
  Legacy HTML tables replaced with **CSS Grid layouts** for improved responsiveness and readability.

- **WBLE Flow Redesign**  
  A dedicated login and campus-selection experience for the Web-Based Learning Environment, separated from the main portal flow.

## 🧠 UX & Design Considerations

- Clear information hierarchy
- Familiar interaction patterns
- Recognition over recall
- Visual grouping (Gestalt principles)
- Consistent spacing, typography, and alignment
- Designed to minimise user confusion in high-information environments

The redesign prioritises **clarity over decoration**, ensuring modern visuals do not interfere with academic usability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Glassmorphism, Grid, animations)
- **JavaScript** (UI interactions, transitions, logic)

> This project is **front-end only** and focuses on layout, interaction, and UX clarity rather than backend functionality.
